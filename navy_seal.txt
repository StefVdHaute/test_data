What the fuck did you just fucking say about me, you little bitch? I’ll have you know I graduated top of my bracket in the WT, and I have over 300 confirmed tournament ribbons. I am trained in psychological warfare and I’m the best topdecker in the entire S-Rank division. You are nothing to me but just another thumbs down emote. I will wipe you the fuck out with topdecks the likes of which has never been seen before on this Earth, mark my fucking words. You think you can get away with saying that shit to me over the Internet? Think again, fucker. As we speak I am contacting my secret network of grandmasters across the world and your IP is being traced right now so you better prepare for the storm, maggot. The storm that wipes out the pathetic little thing you call your mmr. You’re fucking dead, kid. I can be anywhere, anytime, and I can snipe you in over seven hundred ways, and that’s just with blood taura memes. Not only am I extensively trained in unlimited combat, but I have access to the entire arsenal of every card that has ever been printed and I will use it to its full extent to wipe your miserable ass off the face of the ladder, you swamp entangler. If only you could have known what unholy retribution your little “clever” comment was about to bring down upon you, maybe you would have held your fucking tongue. But you couldn’t, you didn’t, and now you’re paying the price, you goddamn idiot. I will poop dervishes all over you and you will drown in it. You’re fucking dead, kiddo.
